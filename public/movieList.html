<h1>The Best Movies Of all time According to Guy</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Best Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Aliens: Romulus</h3>
<p>
	Aliens: Romulus brought the franchise back to its core beginings. A true si-fi
	horror movie that kept me on the edge of my seat and deeply entertained
</p>
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>
	Fight Club is both a cinema and literary classic. Touching on sensitive topics
	of mental health and depression long before these words were even in the main
	stream. "It's only after we've lost everything, that we are free to do
	anything"
</p>
<h3>Erased (Yes it's acutally an anime show)</h3>
<p>
	My final entry into to my top 3 is a bit odd, but wathcing Erased felt more
	like watching a movie with its unusual intro and outro cuts (probably a mistep
	in bringing the movie into an english speaking demograph) the story is
	powerful and the ending twist was one that makes you think you knew what was
	happening and quickly humbles you. I can not recommend this one enough, and
	its an easy watch for non anime lovers also.
